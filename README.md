Just me following the [vulakn-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com)
### TO DO
Need to clean up the code, things like device properties are called multiple times. Instead they should be called once and stored in a variable for multiple use.

## Running the program
You can run the [VulkanTest.out](https://github.com/Not-MilanGurung/Vulkan_Learning/releases/tag/17-01-2024) to see the result.


You can also compile the file yourself by running the `make` command inside HelloTriangle directory.
The shaders should most likey be upto date with the main program but you can run the compile.sh file inside the shaders
directory to recompile the shaders.
